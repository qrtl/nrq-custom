This modules does the following:
  * Adds "Employee" group to the "Defaults: alter personal values only" (XML ID: base.ir_values_default_rule).
  * Adds a new record rule "Defaults: alter all values" to which "Admin / Settings" group is assigned.

Without these adjustments, no one would be able to create user-defined defaults that were applicable for all users.
